LETS BUILD A FOOD ORDER AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPP!

I was going to build this myself and I have 
planned the basic design however for now,
due to time constraints, I am gonna code
along for now. Know that an app could
be made in more than one ways. There is no
fixed design you have to follow but make sure
you follow the best practices always.


React can render an array consisting of JSX elements

Overall look of the project has been achieved. Nothing
too complicated up to this point logic-wise. CSS effects
and animations are dope. Another lesson is that while
starting a project no need to tackle the toughest part
first.


It's time to move on the main logic: Adding Items to the Cart
and Handling Amount.
